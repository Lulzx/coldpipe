Hi {{ first_name }},

I wanted to follow up on my last email. I know things get busy running a practice.

I recently helped a {{ state }} dental office add 47 new implant consultations in one quarter using a system that runs mostly on autopilot.

Happy to share what worked for them if you're interested.

Best,
